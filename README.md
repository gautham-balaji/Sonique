The files contain the core Code of a Discord bot developed by me, Sonique. The files contain the code to connect 
the API Token for connecting to Discord and towards the Host to come Online. The pre-requisuite import files like pycache, Async AutoLib Tools, Discord Tools
and Discord Buttol tools.

As of 2024, the Sonique's API Token has been reset and the Slash Commands integration has not been implemented. 
The bot remains offline.
